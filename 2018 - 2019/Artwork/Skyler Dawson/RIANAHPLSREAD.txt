Hi Rianah! If you're reading this it means you're trying to decipher what happened with this submission.
Good old gordon likes to scan things in as PDF format. This is artwork, pretty obviously doesn't quite fit right.
I've included here a converted version of the submission, converted to a JPG format for an image, pulled directly from the pdf with my own software.
I also included the original pdf in case you need it, and you're totally free to use either one however you like.
Hoping this helps make things a little easier, despite the extra reading for explanation, Enjoy!

Signed, Jaidon Preston.
